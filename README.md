# STATS_Targeted_eLearning_Product_Marketing
This project focuses on how an e-learning company could determine the best markets to offer their programming coursework.  The analysis focuses on both job role aspirations and learner interests, locations and population densities, availability of discretionary funding for learning and isolating outlier effects.  The study concludes with the recommendation to focus on the US, with Canada and India comprising the second-best option for regional sales focus.
